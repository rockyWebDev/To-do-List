This is a cooking calculator that will adjust the recipe's quantities according to the available ammounts.
It will work as a to-do list, you will have to add the original recipe's ingedients and amounts  one by one and then you'd put one or more quantities that you actualy have
and then through a 'rule of 3' calculation the site will adjust all the amounts to fit your criteria.
